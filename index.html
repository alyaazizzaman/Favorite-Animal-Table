    <h2>All of the cities I've lived in.</h2>
    <p>
      I was born in Beverly, Massachussets but since my parents were missionaries when I was growing up we moved quite a bit, finally ending in Tashkent, Uzbekistan.
      After we moved back to the US, I attended college in IL and studied in New Zealand for a semester. After graduating I moved to Denver, and recently to Fort Collins.

    <h2>The Top Cities I'd Like to Visit</h2>
    <p>
      Zanzibar is my top "to visit" city becuase I've never been to Africa and it is my wife's dream to climb Kilimanjaro.
      My brother has spent several years in Madagascar and worked with a local community to improve farming practices, I would love to visit him and see the work he is participating in.
      Lima is also on this list because I have always wanted to see Machu Pichu and hike/run the trails of the Inca.
