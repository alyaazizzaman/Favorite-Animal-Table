    <h2>These are all of the cities I've lived in.</h2>
    <p>
      I was born in Beverly, Massachussets but since my parents were missionaries when I was growing up we moved quite a bit, finally ending in Tashkent, Uzbekistan.
      After we moved back to the US, I attended college in IL and studied in New Zealand for a semester. After graduating I moved to Denver, and recently to Fort Collins.
